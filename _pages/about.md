I am currently a research assistant in the Mathematics Department at Tufts University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Samantha Petti](https://spetti.github.io/). I received my B.S. from Harvard College in 2023, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Na Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/).

My research interests primarily lie in control, learning, and optimization, with a focus on developing strategies for decision making under uncertainty in multi-agent systems.
