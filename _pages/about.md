I am currently a research assistant in the Mathematics Department at Tufts University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Samantha Petti](https://spetti.github.io/). I received an SB from Harvard College in 2023, where I studied electrical engineering and mathematics.

My research interests primarily lie in control, learning, and optimization, with a focus on developing strategies for decision making under uncertainty in multi-agent systems.
