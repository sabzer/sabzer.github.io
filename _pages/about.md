I am currently a first-year PhD student at Harvard University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Na Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/). I received an SB from Harvard College in 2023, where I studied electrical engineering and mathematics.

My research interests primarily lie in control, learning, and optimization, with a focus on developing strategies for decision making under uncertainty in multi-agent systems.
